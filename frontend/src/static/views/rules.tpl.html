            <p>
                In order to protect the experience and safety of people who use ZenDeck, there are some limitations on the type of content and behavior that we allow. All users must adhere to the policies set forth in the ZenDeck Rules. Failure to do so may result in the temporary locking and/or permanent suspension of account(s).
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that we may need to change these rules from time to time and reserve the right to do so. The most current version will always be available at ZenDeck.com/rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>Content Boundaries and Use of ZenDeck</h5>
                <p></p>
                In order to provide the ZenDeck service and the ability to communicate and stay connected with others, there are some limitations on the type of content that can be published with ZenDeck.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trademark: We reserve the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames. Accounts using business names and/or logos to mislead others may be permanently suspended.
                </li>
                <li>Copyright: We will respond to clear and complete notices of alleged copyright infringement. Our copyright procedures are set forth in the <a ui-sref="tnc">Terms of Service</a>.
                </li>
                <li>Graphic content: You may not use pornographic or excessively violent media in your profile image or header image. ZenDeck may allow some forms of graphic content in posts marked as sensitive media. When content crosses the line into gratuitous images of death, ZenDeck may ask that you remove the content out of respect for the deceased.
                </li>
                <li>Unlawful use: You may not use our service for any unlawful purposes or in furtherance of illegal activities. International users agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Abusive Behavior</h5>
            <p>
                We believe in freedom of expression and in speaking truth to power, but that means little as an underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. In order to ensure that people feel safe expressing diverse opinions and beliefs, we do not tolerate behavior that crosses the line into abuse, including behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another user’s voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any accounts and related accounts engaging in the activities specified below may be temporarily locked and/or subject to permanent suspension.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Violent threats (direct or indirect): You may not make threats of violence or promote violence, including threatening or promoting terrorism. Harassment: You may not incite or engage in the targeted abuse or harassment of others. Some of the factors that we may consider when evaluating abusive behavior include: if a primary purpose of the reported account is to harass or send abusive messages to others; if the reported behavior is one-sided or includes threats; if the reported account is inciting others to harass another account; and if the reported account is sending harassing messages to an account from multiple accounts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hateful conduct: You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease. We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multiple account abuse: Creating multiple accounts with overlapping uses or in order to evade the temporary or permanent suspension of a separate account is not allowed. Private information: You may not publish or post other people's private and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, street address, or Social Security/National Identity numbers, without their express authorization and permission. In addition, you may not post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent. Read more about our private information policy here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Impersonation: You may not impersonate others through the ZenDeck service in a manner that is intended to or does mislead, confuse, or deceive others. Read more about our impersonation policy here.

                    Self-harm: You may encounter someone considering suicide or self harm on ZenDeck. When we receive reports that a person is threatening suicide or self harm, we may take a number of steps to assist them, such as reaching out to that person expressing our concern and the concern of other users on ZenDeck or providing resources such as contact information for our mental health partners.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Spam</h5>
            <p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            using feeds of third-party content to update and maintain accounts under the names of those third parties.
                        </li>

                    Spam: You may not use the ZenDeck service for the purpose of spamming anyone. What constitutes “spamming” will evolve as we respond to new tricks and tactics by spammers. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be spamming are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            if you have followed and/or unfollowed large amounts of accounts in a short time period, particularly by automated means (aggressive following or follower churn);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you repeatedly follow and unfollow people, whether to build followers or to garner more attention for your profile;

                        <li>
                            if a large number of people are blocking you;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if a large number of spam complaints have been filed against you;

                        <li>
                            if you post duplicate content over multiple accounts or multiple duplicate updates on one account;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you post multiple unrelated updates to a topic using a tag, trending or popular tag, or promoted tags;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you send large numbers of duplicate replies or mentions;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you send large numbers of unsolicited replies or mentions;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you add a large number of unrelated users to lists;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you repeatedly create false or misleading content;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you are randomly or aggressively following, liking posts, if you repeatedly post other people’s account information as your own (bio, URL, etc.);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you post misleading links (e.g. affiliate links, links to malware/clickjacking pages, etc.);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you are creating misleading accounts or account interactions;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you are selling or purchasing account interactions (such as selling or purchasing followers, likes, etc.); and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            if you are using or promoting third-party services or apps that claim to get you more followers (such as follower trains, sites promising "more followers fast", or any other site that offers to automatically add followers to your account). Accounts created to replace suspended accounts will be permanently suspended.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Accounts under investigation may be removed from search for quality. ZenDeck reserves the right to immediately terminate your account without further notice in the event that, in its judgment, you violate these Rules or the <a ui-sref="tnc">Terms of Service</a>.
