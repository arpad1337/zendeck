If you connect your account on our Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize.

When you privately communicate with others through our Services, such as by sending and receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications, and information related to them. Please note that if you interact with public ZenDeck content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet shared via Direct Message, those interactions may be public.

            <p><strong>Links:</strong><br>
                We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means.
